        "### Static Variables\n",
        "\n",
        "In some languages, a static variable is one that retains its value across function calls. Python doesn’t have static variables in the same sense, but you can achieve similar behavior using function attributes or class attributes.\n",

        "### Key Components\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Automatic Memory Management**:\n",
        "   - Python automatically handles memory allocation and deallocation using a garbage collector. Developers do not need to manually manage memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Reference Counting**:\n",
        "   - Each object in Python maintains a reference count that tracks how many references point to it. When the reference count drops to zero, the memory for that object is freed.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Garbage Collection**:\n",
        "   - Python includes a garbage collector to handle cyclic references (where objects reference each other in a loop). The garbage collector identifies and cleans up these cycles to reclaim memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Memory Pools**:\n",
        "   - Python uses memory pools for small objects to reduce fragmentation and improve allocation efficiency. For example, the `pymalloc` allocator manages memory for small objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Dynamic Typing**:\n",
        "   - Python's dynamic typing system can cause additional memory overhead as types and object attributes are managed at runtime.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Summary**:\n",
        "- Python uses **reference counting** and **garbage collection** to manage memory.\n",
        "- **Memory pools** help manage small object allocations.\n",

        "### Four Assumptions of Normal Distribution\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Symmetry**:\n",
        "   - **Explanation**: The distribution is symmetric about the mean. This means that the left and right halves of the distribution are mirror images of each other.\n",
        "   - **Implication**: The mean, median, and mode are all located at the center of the distribution, and probabilities of deviations on either side of the mean are equal.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Mean and Variance**:\n",
        "   - **Explanation**: The normal distribution is fully described by its mean (\\(\\mu\\)) and variance (\\(\\sigma^2\\)). The mean determines the location of the center of the distribution, and the variance (or standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\)) determines the spread or width of the distribution.\n",
        "   - **Implication**: Knowing the mean and standard deviation allows us to determine the probability of a variable falling within a specific range.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Empirical Rule (68-95-99.7 Rule)**:\n",
        "   - **Explanation**: Approximately 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean, 95% within two standard deviations, and 99.7% within three standard deviations.\n",
        "   - **Implication**: This rule helps in understanding the spread of data and is used for probability calculations and making predictions about the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Asymptotic**:\n",
        "   - **Explanation**: The tails of the normal distribution approach the horizontal axis but never actually touch it. This means that while the probability of extreme values becomes very small, it never reaches zero.\n",
        "   - **Implication**: Extreme values are possible, though very unlikely, and the tails extend infinitely in both directions.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Summary\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Normal Distribution**: A bell-shaped curve defined by its mean and standard deviation.\n",

        "  1. **Symmetry**: The distribution is symmetric around the mean.\n",
        "  2. **Mean and Variance**: The distribution is defined by these two parameters.\n",
        "  3. **Empirical Rule**: 68-95-99.7% of data falls within one, two, and three standard deviations from the mean.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Symmetry**:\n",

        "\n",
        "2. **Bell-Shaped**:\n",
        "   - The curve has a bell shape, with the highest point at the mean. It gradually tapers off towards both ends.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Mean, Median, and Mode**:\n",
        "   - All three measures of central tendency are equal and located at the center of the distribution.\n",

        "4. **Defined by Two Parameters**:\n",

        "     - 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation (\\(\\mu \\pm \\sigma\\)) from the mean.\n",

        "\n",
        "6. **Asymptotic**:\n",
        "   - The tails of the curve approach, but never touch, the horizontal axis. This implies that the probability of extreme values decreases but never reaches zero.\n",
        "\n",
