        "### Static Variables\n",
        "\n",
        "In some languages, a static variable is one that retains its value across function calls. Python doesn’t have static variables in the same sense, but you can achieve similar behavior using function attributes or class attributes.\n",

        "### Key Components\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Automatic Memory Management**:\n",
        "   - Python automatically handles memory allocation and deallocation using a garbage collector. Developers do not need to manually manage memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Reference Counting**:\n",
        "   - Each object in Python maintains a reference count that tracks how many references point to it. When the reference count drops to zero, the memory for that object is freed.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Garbage Collection**:\n",
        "   - Python includes a garbage collector to handle cyclic references (where objects reference each other in a loop). The garbage collector identifies and cleans up these cycles to reclaim memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Memory Pools**:\n",
        "   - Python uses memory pools for small objects to reduce fragmentation and improve allocation efficiency. For example, the `pymalloc` allocator manages memory for small objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Dynamic Typing**:\n",
        "   - Python's dynamic typing system can cause additional memory overhead as types and object attributes are managed at runtime.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Summary**:\n",
        "- Python uses **reference counting** and **garbage collection** to manage memory.\n",
        "- **Memory pools** help manage small object allocations.\n",
